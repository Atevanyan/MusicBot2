# MusicBot
A reinforcement AI program that suggests music that a user may like. Utilizes Spotify Web API and Python

# Description:
The initial idea is to create a music suggestion AI. Much like pandora or spotify but hopefully better. The idea is to start with a simple AI that will just categorize the genre of the music being played by the user and suggest other songs within that genre. Over the course of the semester we hope to make this AI more robust and start factoring in things such rhythm, lyrical content etc. We think this would be fun to do because then we could see our AI “learn” and grow in the quality of recommendation. Also spotify and pandora music recommendation sucks.
